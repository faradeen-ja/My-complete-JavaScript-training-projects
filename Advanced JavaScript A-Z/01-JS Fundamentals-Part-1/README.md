##### What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.*

* ParadigmMulti-paradigm: event-driven, functional, imperative, procedural, object-oriented programming

* Designed byBrendan Eich of Netscape initially; others have also contributed to the ECMAScript standard

##### Working with variables in JavaScript

A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data. To create a variable in JavaScript, use the var, let and const keywords to declare a variable.  A variable can only contain one value at a time, which can be of any data type. Meaning either a string, number, boolean, array, object, function or null or undefined.   *like e.g. code code below*  **[Source](javascript.info/variables)**
```JavaScript
let js = 'amazing';
     
      40 + 30 - 4;
      console.log(40 + 30 - 4);

      console.log('fara');

      console.log(23);


      let firstNameOne = "fara";
      let first = 'fara'
      let last = 'j'
      
      console.log(firstNameOne);
      console.log(firstNameOne);
      console.log(firstNameOne);
 ```
 
 e.g. 2
 ```JavaScript
 let pets = "cats, dogs";
let catName = "sally";
let dogsAges = [2, 5];

// logging results into console
console.log(pets) // cats, dogs
console.log(catName) // sally
cosole.log(dogsAges[0]) // 2
