This repository only to log my personal learning records and keep live, I suggest checking the main course which is provided by Jonas on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@rVdTgePKahl_Ua0pZ_6SOkJZlbxE-bMT8s3T6cJWba3cW546xNaTp7G6iMn9gng12w==/), it's rebust infromative and for anyone to start learning JavaScript from a deep level prospective. you my find these logs useful going thru magic notes :) if taking this course.
