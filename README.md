## Hi




<h6 align="center">
This repository exist only to log my personal learning records and keep live, I suggest checking the main course which is provided by Jonas on 

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@rVdTgePKahl_Ua0pZ_6SOkJZlbxE-bMT8s3T6cJWba3cW546xNaTp7G6iMn9gng12w==/), it's rebust infromative 
and for anyone to start learning JavaScript from a deep level prospective. however, you may still find these logs useful going thru magic notes ðŸª„ :) if taking this course.
